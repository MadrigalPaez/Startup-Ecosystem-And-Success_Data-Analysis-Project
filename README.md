# Startup Ecosystem: An analysis of IPO and acquisition drivers

## Objective:
In the high-stakes world of startups, a successful exit is the ultimate goal. But what defines that success? What drives it? This project dives into a **global dataset of 5,000 startups** to uncover the fundamental differences between two major exit strategies: a public offering (IPO) and an acquisition. As a simulated data analyst project, the goal is to move beyond speculation and use data to **identify the key financial, operational, and categorical characteristics** that predict a startup's most likely path to success.

## Context:
For investors and founders, understanding the trajectory of a startup is critical for making strategic decisions. Stakeholders in the venture capital and startup ecosystem are particularly interested in understanding:

* The different **archetypes of startups** that exist in the global landscape.
* The **key performance indicators (KPIs)** that signal a company is on track for a high-value exit.
* How factors like **industry and geography** influence a startup's potential and ultimate exit strategy.

## Key Business Questions:
* **Startup Profiling & Segmentation:**
    * What does a "typical" successful startup look like?
    * How do the characteristics of startups differ across industries and funding stages?
    * Can we segment startups into meaningful groups based on their performance metrics?

* **Exit Strategy Analysis:**
    * Are there clear, data-driven differences between startups that achieve an IPO versus those that are acquired?
    * What financial and efficiency ratios are most influential for each exit path?

* **Geographic & Industry Trends:**
    * Does a startup's path to success vary depending on its country or industry?
    * Which industries and continents are hubs for IPOs versus acquisitions?

## Stakeholders:
* **Venture Capital Investor:** Identify startups with the highest potential for a high return. What metrics should they look for to distinguish a future IPO from a smaller acquisition?"*
* **Startup Founder:** Planning a long-term strategy, focusing on rapid growth to aim for an IPO, or build an efficient, profitable business that would be an attractive acquisition target.
* **Financial Analyst:** Study how trends and geographical location impact startup valuations and the likelihood of a successful exit.

## Tools & Methods:
* **Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn):** Used for data cleaning, feature engineering (creating new ratios), and building predictive models (Logistic regression & clustering).
* **Data Visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn):** Used to create plots for exploratory analysis and to visualize model results, such as feature importance and ROC curves.
* **Tableau:** Used to create a comprehensive and interactive dashboard for visualizing the key findings and presenting the final business case.

## Analysis & Visualizations:

The complete analysis and key findings are presented in an interactive Tableau Storyboard. This dashboard provides a visual narrative of the project, from initial exploration to the final predictive insights.
